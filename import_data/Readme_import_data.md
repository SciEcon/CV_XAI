1. Volume Data from CMC: Using API provided by Coinmarketcap would lead to high subscription cost. Although other sources such as coingecko and cryptocompare offer free APIs, the exchange volume they offer does not include on-chain transaction volume. So we simply copy-paste historical data from Coinmarketcap to Microsoft Excel to get CMC.csv for research purpose only.
