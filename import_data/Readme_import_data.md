1. Volume Data from CMC: to use api from Coinmarketcap leads to high subscription cost. Although other sources such as coingecko and cryptocompare offers free api, the exchange volume they offer does not include on-chain transaction volume. So we simply copy-paste historical data from Coinmarketcap to Microsoft Excel to get CMC.csv for research purpose only.
